# v^SPEED VARIO

v^SPEED VARIO: <br />
a Self-Built Paragliding Variometer / Vertical Speed Indicator. <br />
(The thing that goes beep beep when you are climbing in a thermal.) <br /> 

Features:<br />
Adafruit Feather Bluefruit M0,<br />
MS5611 Barometric Pressure/Temperature Sensor (SPI mode),<br />
0.66" OLED display (SPI mode),<br />
Material cost for ten: as low as $45 each <br />
Material cost for one: as low as $77 each <br />
Compatible with Android & iOS bluetooth devices. <br />

# Buy one from me for $60 -- OR -- Make your own for $77
If you want a PROTOTYPE2 (V2), email me at vSpeedVario@gmail.com ... I can buy enough materials for ten variometers so the material cost for each variometer can be as low as $45, or you can make your own single variometer for as low as $77. I'm offering a very very small price mark up until I sell at least ten variometers. (I'm hoping to never raise the price above $60 anyway.)

-- OR YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN! (with a headache) --

...This is an open-source project found on GitHub:
( https://github.com/glydrfreak )

...Also a public Google Drive Folder: (same link above)
( https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B610ABpCama_UF9jZ3pDQzFWTkE )

But be careful not to get too involved, because it may just eat away your whole entire Summer, prohibit you from sleeping all night, and even may cause you to actually study everything about electronics.

I have modified Adafruit's "Bluefruit LE Connect" for Android only so far, and the source code can be found in the Android folder. Just plop it into Android Studio and upload it to your Android device. I have not published anything to Google Play yet, and I am still learning iOS. Stay tuned for the iOS version of the app, and also more info about the Android app will be posted soon.

Adafruit's "Bluefruit LE Connect" (without my modifications) is available to download on your mobile device from Google Play and the App Store, and will work in UART mode, via sending characters between the Feather Bluefruit M0 and your mobile device.
