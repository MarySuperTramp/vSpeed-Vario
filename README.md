v^SPEED VARIO:

If you want a Prototype2, then email me at vSpeedVario@gmail.com ... Please keep in mind it's still in the freshly developed stage, but because of this, you may also get lucky with what else I have to offer you with the Prototype2 ;)

ONLY TEN PROTOTYPE2's WILL BE PRODUCED AND SOLD AT MATERIAL COST, and only after that will I be able to move on to produce the better prototypes I have in progress. Otherwise I would not be able to afford buying the new materials for newer prototypes. 

-- OR YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN! (with a headache) --

...This is an open-source project found on GitHub:
( https://github.com/glydrfreak/vSpeedVario )

...Also a public Google Drive Folder: (same link above)
( https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B610ABpCama_UF9jZ3pDQzFWTkE )

But be careful not to get too involved, because it may just eat away your whole entire Summer, prohibit you from sleeping all night, and even may cause you to actually study everything about electronics.
 
This is a Self-Built Paragliding Variometer / Vertical Speed Indicator. (The thing that beeps when you are climbing in a thermal.) This is my second working prototype. 

Features:

Adafruit Feather Bluefruit 32u4,

MS5611 Barometric Pressure/Temperature Sensor (SPI mode),

0.66" OLED display (SPI mode),

Compatible with Android & iOS bluetooth devices. 
Adafruit Bluefruit Connect (without my modifications) is available to download on your mobile device, and will work in UART mode, sending text characters between the FeatherBluefruit32u4 and your mobile device.

Material cost: $62
