The only footage I have for the app is during an Imagine Dragons concert in a low averaging setting--  <br />

(At about 1:20 the heavy base ramps up during the song and makes the barometric sensor data go nuts!) <br />

# Buy one for $60 -- OR -- Make your own for $77
If you want a PROTOTYPE2 (V2), email me at vSpeedVario@gmail.com ... I can buy enough materials for ten variometers so the material cost for each variometer can be as low as $45, or you can make your own single variometer for as low as $77. I'm offering a very very small price mark up until I sell at least ten variometers. (I'm hoping to never raise the price above $60 anyway.)


...This is an open-source project found on GitHub:
( https://github.com/glydrfreak )

But be careful not to get too involved, because it may just eat away your whole entire Summer, prohibit you from sleeping all night, and even may cause you to actually study everything about electronics.

I have modified Adafruit's "Bluefruit LE Connect" for Android only so far, and the source code can be found in the Android folder. Just plop it into Android Studio and upload it to your Android device. I have not published anything to Google Play yet, and I am still learning iOS. Stay tuned for the iOS version of the app, and also more info about the Android app will be posted soon.

Adafruit's "Bluefruit LE Connect" (without my modifications) is available to download on your mobile device from Google Play and the App Store, and will work in UART mode, via sending characters between the Feather Bluefruit M0 and your mobile device.
